Upgrade 7.7
===========

General
-------
Rebuilt all DLLs after resolving DBO size problem (moved clipplane handle to meshradius handle)

Sprite
------
New parameters for SET SPRITE RESIZE autosize, global X offset, global X scale (0.0-1.0)

Core
----
Added new function PERFFREQ by request. 
Updated PERFTIMER function
ARRAY COUNT of undefined array now returns -1 instead of 0 (which would be identical to an array with a single item)


Input
-----
Small tweak to input system (Touch Gesture, but not used)
Fixed touch code so it does not mess up regular click code
Additional flag added to CHANGE MOUSE Pointer Index, Touch Friendly (1-allow touch to persist 250ms)

Image
-----
You can now open an existing imageblock to continue writing to it. Delete the imageblock file to start again

Sound
-----
Fixed issue with OGG sounds not detecting end of loop or end of sound (sound playing()=0)
When pausing and then unpausing a looped sound, the sound would stop playing at the end - this has been corrected

Further tweaked OGG file end detection to handle more OGG types

Music
-----
Major reorganisation of the Music plug-in - separation of the 3 different music player types into classes

Math
----
Reserve vector/matrix 0 for library use, in line with other libraries - currently protect unavailable id's from update
Re-engineer structures of the vector classes - now safely polymorphic, and no larger than before

Basic2D
-------
Gradient box now restores AA setting when done

Light
-----
Replace CData class with std::map within the Light libraries
Cache pointer to last light found
Minor code cleanup within light library

Sprite
------
Tweaks to the sprite code

File
----
Extra info in SET DIR error 

Object
------
Now clip the end of an OBJECT animation
Fixed bug causing ray cast material artitary value to reset too late (inside loop)
Added parameter to SET OBJECT EFFECT called Force CPU Animation - ideal for bone detection
Added MaxAnistropic render state setting to detect best card can provide (filter mode 2)

Terrain
-------
Fixed Delete Terrain crash

ODE
---
Fixed bug causing ODE to force the player borble hack (65534) down when a reasonable character controller should only push back and up

Internal Work
-------------
Replace CData class with std::map

Replaced dual containers with a single container and a class structure

Pretty much rewrote every command
Accidentally missed committing the Bitmap/Bitmap.vcproj file:
