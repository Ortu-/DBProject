DBPro9Ex is an updated version of the latest open source version of DarkBASIC Professional available through GitHub: https://github.com/LeeBamberTGC/Dark-Basic-Pro
It reverts a lot of GameGuru-specific behaviour to the original DBPro functionality, includes plenty of fixes to broken commands and third party plugins, memory leaks, missing resources and so on. In addition to this the core engine has been updated to use DirectX 9Ex, the final DirectX version to be officially available for Windows XP. It's main advantages over DirectX 9.0c comes with a newer OS though; starting with Windows Vista 9Ex offers improved screen presenting functionality utilizing the Desktop Window Manager. What's more, video memory can be retained through display mode changes, something that was not available with the old DBPro versions. Finally, D3D9Ex supports texture sharing with newer DirectX runtimes. This release is prepared for that and will be able to handle sharing textures with my Ziggurat (DirectX 11) plugin in its next public release (version 0.5).
Apart from that, VRAM resource allocation has been overhauled from the original approach used by DBPro and should hopefully result in somewhat faster resource loading and memblock / vertexdata updates.
Support for third-party external precompilers has also been added.
