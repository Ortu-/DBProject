10/09/02 Patch 1 Notes
======================

General Fixes
-------------
* Cursors specified in the editor are once again accessable via CHANGE MOUSE
* Paste Image now in line with DBV1 compatability. The extra param controls transparency
* Setting the style of text multiple times within a loop no longer causes text artifacts
* File commands that manipulated memblocks did not tie into the main memblock memory area
* Activated all the Runtime Warning errors to completely report avoidable command failures
* New DBProAssociator written to correctly link DBPRO and DBA filetypes to editor
* Arrays used as subscripts to other multidimensional arrays messed up - 4 hours to fix!
* Black on Black Transparent Text did not get displayed on the screen
* Fixed once and for all the matrix ground height finding function. Now smooth as silk!
* print 1.0=1.1 and print 1.0<1.1 now report correct float math comparisons
* Fixed bug that allowed arrays to be used without being declared causing confusion
* Corrected spelling of Principles in help system
* Fixed a bug where spaces within a complex data structure would be eaten, ie (array count())
* Expressions used as part of array subscript calculations would not be used correctly
* Arrays that omit a subscript will now correctly use the internal array index for list access
* User type fields would not be parsed correctly if expression contained a nested field
* Fixed a bug which now loads images into the entire texture plate by default as in DBV1
* Added ability for the PREPARE MATRIX TEXTURE to stretch a manual image to fix black areas bugs
* Fixed a bug where the last tile height of a matrix could not be assigned
* PLAY ANIMATION TO IMAGE can now handle image regions smaller and larger than the anim source
* PLAY ANIMATION TO IMAGE can now render to existing images and within sub-regions too
* INC and DEC now work inside functions correctly
* An array declaration on the last line of a program could not compile, now fixed
* Some parameter declarations within functions would not be parsed correctly (ie red(file$) )
* SET CAMERA TO IMAGE can now handle recreation of larger depth buffers during multiple calls
* SET CAMERA TO IMAGE now enforces only image sizes to a power of two for better texture handling
* GET IMAGE now works like DBV1, with an optional parameter for using the DBPro accuracy method
* Single letter variables now parse correctly when used as a user defined type
* Array subscripts less than a negative value of one will no longer stray into raw memory
* POSITION MOUSE now accurately positions the mouse at the designated coordinates in all modes
* SELECT CASE items would not correctly detect floats and cause logic errors, now fixed
* Variables that would use the assignment symbol but not place a R-value no longer crash
* RETURN commands placed outside of a subroutine would crash the exe, now safely exits
* Line comments are now allowed inside user defined type declarations
* Constants no longer replace words that are inside speech marks
* Added Soft Runtime warnings to silently ignore errors such as not loading via LOAD DLL
* Added code to prevent a curve speed value from being assigned below a value of one
* Global Strings declared without a string value would crash the exe, now fixed
* Expression commands that required a DWORD input param would become wrong when passed an array
* Now reports a correct error when an array is declared without brackets
* LOAD and SAVE ARRAY now fixed to correctly detect an array and additionally restricts usertypes
* Variables that share the same user defined type can now be assigned using the equate symbol
