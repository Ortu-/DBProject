Upgrade 7.1
===========

TGC CONVENTION 2008 Credits
---------------------------

 * Thanks to IANM for his suggestion to add USER TYPE DATA into the EXECUTABLE,
   adding Scientific Notation and the GET ARRAY TYPE and GET TYPE PATTERN commands
 * Thanks to GREENGANDALF for his suggestion of LOAD IMAGE for volume textures
   and fixing the MAKE SOUND FROM MEMBLOCK so many more 'larger' WAVs can be used
 * Thanks to SCRAGGLE for his ideas resulting in MEMBLOCKS being added to DBOs
 * Thanks to DIGGORY for his help in developing a new external debugger, and the
   arm-twisting that allowed any DBPro application to expose its internal pointers
 * And thanks to everyone else who combined their ideas into a great DBPro push!

 * Updated PRINCIPALS section on BOOLEAN OPERATORS
 * OPEN TO READ updated
 * LOAD IMAGE, SCALE LIMB TEXTURE and SCALE OBJECT TEXTURE help page updated
 * SCROLL LIMB TEXTURE and SCROLL OBJECT TEXTURE help page updated
 * Added ZWRITE and ZREAD to BASIC3D sub category of commands
 * SET DIR and CD help pages updated
 * Updated the SET SCREEN EFFECT and TEXTURE SCREEN commands
 * Added new SNIPPET example showing how to use XBOX 360 controller input device
 * Added help for SET DISPLAY MODE to include VSYNC, ANTIALIAS and MULTIMONITOR
 * Reduced description in SCALE SPRITE command so second parameter is not clipped
 * Removed ALWAYS ACTIVE ON/OFF from Help Index, these are obsolete commands
 * Updated help generator to correct CONSTANT and INCLUDE help links
 * Removed APPEND OBJECT ANIMATION from help index
 * Updated AUTOMATIC OBJECT COLLISIOn with additional info on sliding collision mode
 * Updated ATAN to reflect ARCTANGENT in description and correct range
 * Updated SET CAMERA FOV to correct default description of 61.9621391296
 * Updated the SET OBJECT SPEED command with more accurate info on speed value
 * Added array name description for core array commands and updated some examples
 * Added extra help in principals for Power symbol and integer/real division

 * Updated getting started to offer dual help for the old(default) and new(DGS) interfaces
 * Added additional new commands to the INDEX page
 * Added more example and help to FTP CONNECT page
 * Added more help to the LOAD EFFECT command

Compiler and EXE
----------------
 
 * Added support for Scientific Notation as literal (i.e. 1.0E + 38 or 1E20, etc)
 * Compiler now exports internal type structure pattern data (obtain via GET TYPE PATTERN$)
 * If application executable does not use Basic3D, then do not check for DirectX (GDI)
 * Core can obtain DirectX version with GET DX VERSION$() even in GDI mode (no Basic3D)
 * Added new support for external debuggers using a MUTEX just before code executed
 * Above code creates a mutex and filemap called Appname.exe(Mutex) & Appname.exe(FileMap) [case sensitive], using "debugme" in filemap to pause app
 * New GLOBSTRUCT edited to support above (no data structure changes, just a rename)
 * Removed FILL X with X from DBM export to aid in creation of external debugger
 * Usurped use of the EXEPATH string in GLOBSTRUCT to carry extra runtime error info
 * Above will produce a new single error message box containing 'any' extra error text
 * Fixed bug caused by removing FillX in DBM (restored ability to calculate local variable offsets)
 * Fixed line number issue in DBM to help external debuggers trace correct progress
 * A single GameFX command in an empty program no longer crashes the compiler
 * Added DLL support for new as yet unreleased product, GreenEAR, to be announced shortly
 * Fixed string corruption leak caused by new datatype pattern string system
 * Fixed bug causing left side operand not casting if array type (i.e. INT * FLOAT = INT bug)
 * Forced safety code for subsciptless array calls ( i.e. A() ) to avoid crash when safe arrays off

Core
----

 * New command called pattern$=GET TYPE PATTERN$(typename$,index) to get type format
 * New command called GET ARRAY TYPE to return internal type index of the array
 * Fixed bug causing array delete element to leak memory if string in user type used
 * Modified application executable so window does not minimise before closing window
 * Set CHANGE MOUSE to value of 32 will cease to use SetCursor in WM_MOUSEMOVE
 * Added DRAW TO CAMERA and DRAW TO SCREEN to support quicker post process shaders
 * Removed assumption that Basic3D is loaded in for post process quad rendering

Display
-------

 * Added TEXTURE SCREEN and SET SCREEN EFFECT to support quicker post process shaders
 * Removed some hack code from DarkGDK merging causing Vista users to get Multisamping X2 no matter what

Image
-----

 * Added support in LOAD IMAGE for mode 3 which now loads a volume texture
 * Fixed bug in GET IMAGE mode 3 which used color-key when it should not have

Memblock
--------

 * Fixed bug that caused SOUND FROM MEMBLOCK to cast DWORD data to WORD (sound crash)

Basic3D
-------

 * Special case allowance for instances to cast shadows if shader flag set to one
 * New commands added; ADD MEMBLOCK TO OBJECT, GET MEMBLOCK FROM OBJECT, DELETE MEMBLOCK FROM OBJECT (only adds a memblock to the object, does not represent the object!)
 * Fixed bug causing any reflection views to be overridden by code in UpdateInitOnce
 * Added new mode 3 to SET OBJECT FRAME to cause bounds to recreate without frame zero shift
 * If SET REFLECTION SHADING ON command used, all frustrum culling is disabled
 * Added error information to a mesh load failure (includes ID and filename)
 * Objects excluded cause the object render order to refresh (keeps 3D up to date)
 * SET OBJECT TO OBJECT ORIENTATION has also been fixed no longer crashes if flag used
 * Removed EXCLUDE code from TEXTURE SORT code (to regain SYNC speed from U69)
 * Added two new parameter values to SET GLOBAL OBJECT CREATION (2 and 3) with help
 * LOAD OBJECT can now detect model texture files in absolute paths, relative within model file
 * Fixed bug causing trianglelist meshes and trianglestrip meshes not to combine in one object
 * Added new parameter to LOAD EFFECT which allows secondary UV data to be stripped from a shaded object

Sound
-----

 * Fixed bug causing sound to crash if try to delete an unloaded OGG during the load
 * Added new parameter to LOAD SOUND and LOAD3DSOUND for Global Sound Flag
 * String table updated to hold new Global Sound Flag parameter for command

Animation
---------

 * Fixed bug introduced when GDK code copied over to DBP source code (IFDEF WINKLE)

gameFX
------

 * Improved ADD LOD TO OBJECT slightly to introduce automated alpha blending
