Upgrade 5.9
===========

Information
-----------

 * Released two new and unsupported DLLs called ODE and MultiplayerPlus (FPSC support)
 * New commands added to U5.9 but undocumented for this release (FPSC support only)

Information about FPSCExtras (supplimentary release)
----------------------------

 * Released the DBPRO DLL source code to the ODE, making it open source to the community
 * Released the FPSC game engine source code fully compatible with U5.9 upgrade
 * The files in the supplimentary release contains a replacement Enhancements.DLL!

General
-------

 * Numerous small fixes and changes within several DLLs due to FPSC development
 

Basic3D
-------

 * New command named "calculate object bounds ID", this can be used to calculate an objects bounds for collision and visibility etc.
 * Alpha mapping an instanced object no longer forces loss of transparency
 * Fog no longer interferes with shaders
 * Radius of objects are now updated when "offset limb" is used, this solves the problem of objects disappearing that have been offset
 * Deleted lights are now removed completely
 * Fixed an issue with "set object" when wireframe state was ignored
 * Point camera will revert to Euler rotation automatically
 * Instanced objects can now be cloned
 * Fixed a problem where cloned objects did not correctly match position data of source object
 * Copy bitmap command now updates size correctly on both axis
 * Resolved a potential crash on "make memblock from file"
 * The command "create animated sprite" no longer crashes when an invalid image is used
 * Animated sprites now use the 1 texture flag by default ( 1 to 1 pixel mapping )
 * Error message now displayed on "open to write" if invalid index is used
 * When setting an object to another objects orientation the pivot is now retained, you can specify an extra parameter 1 to ignore to ensure the pivot matches the other object
 * The command "make mesh from object" no longer crashes after a resolution change
 * Instanced objects can now have their own independant alpha settings
 * Resolved a crash with certain shader settings
 * The size of a sprite is now updated when their image is changed to match the dimensions of the image
 * Stopped a possible crash with "sprite collision" not checking for existence of both sprites
 * Object looping property correctly updated when animation has stopped
 * Alternative "make object plain" command, add extra parameter of 1 to use this
 * Instanced objects will use pivot data from source object
 * Object size values now take into account any pivot data
 * Basic 2D pixel plotter now adds an extra check to ensure not drawing outside of surface bounds
