</CENTER></FONT></B></FONT><BR>
For those users who are moving their project over to Dark Basic Professional, or have upgraded and want to get up and running as quickly as possible, the following tips may help your transition.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Command Line Interface<BR>
</FONT><BR>
The CLI is now part of the Debugger and can be located by clicking the Debug Mode Button in the main editor. You will find many of the reasons for having a CLI have been replaced with more powerful Variable Watcher and Program Watcher tools.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Desktop Full screen Standard<BR>
</FONT><BR>
The default running mode for all Dark Basic Professional programs is FULLSCREEN DESKTOP. This means the application runs in windows mode stretched to the size of the desktop. This is a preferred method of rendering with modern hardware and WindowsXP. Your framerates are faster and you have full cross-application ability throughout the execution of your program. You still have the option for full screen exclusive mode, as well as hidden mode, standard window mode and a special fullscreen desktop mode which retains the taskbar in case you are writing a tool rather than an a game which ideally plays into the entire screen. Be aware some older cards incur a performance penalty when running in full screen desktop mode.<BR>
