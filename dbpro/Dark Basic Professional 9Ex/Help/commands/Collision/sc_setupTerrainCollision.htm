SYNTAX<BR>

    SC_setupTerrainCollision  TerrainNum , GroupNum , FreeObject

<BR><BR>
        <u>-TerrainNum</u>:    the terrain you want to setup<br>
        <u>-GroupNum</u>:      the group that you want this terrain to belong to (0 for no group)<br>
        <u>-FreeObject</u>:    Specify an object that is not currently in use that can be used to temporarily store <br>
                               data about the terrain's limbs. This object will become free again when this command<br>
                               has finished executing.<br><br>
		
        Mesh 255 and memblock 255 must not be in use.<br>
        A Terrain requires special setup since it contains many polygons seperated into limbs. In general an object<br>
	  with limbs can be setup normally using either setupObject or setupComplexObject. However if the total number<br>
	  of polygons across all the limbs exceeds around 21000 polygons these commands will crash.<br>
	  SetupTerrainCollision has been designed to extract the polygon data from each limb one at a time, and build<br>
	  a collision tree based on all the data. The end result is the same as any other setup command, so other<br>
	  collision commands (e.g. rayCast or updateObject) can be called as usual on a terrain.
