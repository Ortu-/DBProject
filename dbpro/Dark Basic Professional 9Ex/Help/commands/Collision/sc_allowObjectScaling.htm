SYNTAX<BR>

    SC_allowObjectScaling  objNum

<BR><BR>
        <u>-objNum</u>:    the object you want to be able to scale<br>
	    <br>
		Normally, after setupObject is called, no further scaling of the object will be recorded <br>
		in the collision data. If you are not planning to scale the object after setup then this <br>
		is fine and you do not need to call this command. This command will allow 'updateObject' <br>
		to update the object's size as well as it's position and rotation. However, checking lots <br>
		of collision against an object that is allowed to scale will be slightly slower.<br>
		You cannot turn off scaling to make it faster again, the only way is to re-setup <br>
		the object to overwrite the data.<br>
