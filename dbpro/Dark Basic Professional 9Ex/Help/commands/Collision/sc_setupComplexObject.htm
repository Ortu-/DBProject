SYNTAX<BR>

    SC_setupComplexObject  objNum , GroupNum , FacesPerNode

<BR><BR>
        <u>-objNum</u>:        the object you want to setup<br>
        <u>-groupNum</u>:      the group that you want this object to belong to (0 for no group)<br>
        <u>-FacesPerNode</u>:  sets the maximum number of faces per tree node, usually the smaller this value the better the performance, if unsure of this value set it to 2<br>
                      		
        Mesh 255 and memblock 255 must not be in use.<br>
        almost exactly the same as setup object except this command will setup optimized polygon collision on a <br>
        complex (high poly) object so that you get much better performance for these types of object.<br>
        realistically three is little difference between this and normal polygon collision<br>
        for objects of less than 30-40 polys, but higher polycounts definately benifit from higher performance.<br>
        You can think of it as splitting the object up into little bits, of size specified by facesPerNode,<br>
        and only checking collision with sections near a collision, therefore cutting out alot of polygons.	<br>
