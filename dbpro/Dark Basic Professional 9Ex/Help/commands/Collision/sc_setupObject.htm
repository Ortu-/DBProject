SYNTAX<BR>

    SC_setupObject  objNum , GroupNum , Collision Type

<BR><BR>

        <u>-objNum</u>:        the object you want to setup<br>
        <u>-groupNum</u>:      the group that you want this object to belong to (0 for no group)<br>
        <u>-collisionType</u>: sets the type of collision to use with this object<br>
                              0 - polygon collision, will check with every polygon in the object<br>
                              1 - sphere collision, will create a sphere around the object to use in collisions<br>
                              2 - box collision, will create a box around the object for collisions.<br>
<br>
		Mesh 255 and memblock 255 must not be in use.<br>
		This command sets up an object for ray casting, object collision, and sliding collision, it need <br>
            only be called once for each object. This command will also work when the object has been <br>
		scaled before calling it but any further scaling of the object will not be updated in the collision<br>
		unless you allow it. <a href="sc_allowObjectSclaing.htm">SC_allowObjectScaling</a> <br><br>

		setupObject can be sucessfully called on an existing object, doing so<br>
		will overwrite any stored collision data with the new object's data and reset collision to ON<br>
		and scaling to False. The only drawback is re-settingup a complex/polygon object may take time.<br>
