Upgrade 6.6
===========

Compiler
--------

 * Fixed error line reporting bug, caused by comments between CASE statements in SELECT statement (Statement.cpp:1540)

Basic3D
-------

 * No longer scans for shared vertex/index resources if object flagged as using unique buffers (speed-up)
 * Fixed a memory crash caused by a recent attempt to free up all object resource allocations (one exit)
 * Fixed ability of objects to self-cull when off camera, and harmonized with the never-cull mode (radius=0)
 * Fixed object culling so that it uses the camera set by SET CURRENT CAMERA instead of the last camera rendered
 * Added an epsilon value to the automated object culling for very fine edge contact with spherical objects

Core
----

 * Modified PRINT float code so that a regular precision is used (rather than .12g precision)

Math
----

 * Added undocumented command to extract data from a MATRIX4 ( f# = GET MATRIX4 ELEMENT ( M, Index ) )

Sync With GDK Fixes (does not affect DBPRO)
-------------------

 * NOTE: U6.5 used DLLs from U6.4. U6.6 contains the actual DLLS for the changes below
 * SetCameraClip function added to Camera DLL
 * Added 'm_dwUseDynamicTextureMask' field to reintroduce U64
 * Added to code to support above flag (DBPFormat.cpp)
 * Added code to set the stage value when TEXTURE OBJECT used (DBOMesh.cpp)
 * New function added caled getKeyStateEX (GDK)
 * Function WriteToRegistryS parameter change (GDK)
 * GHOST ON function reactivates flag to promote object to the ghost layer
 * GLUE TO LIMB added commentry, no functional changes
 * INTERSECT OBJECT activates ability for instanced object use
 * Exposed full LOAD OBJECT parameters to GDK
 * VertexSystemMemory function name corrected to GDK
 * SetObjectDisableTransform function name updated to GDK
 * Instance Object return flag code added to common.cpp for GDK
 * Commented out FOG COLOR render state in built-in particle update function (GDK fix)
 * VALR reintroduced to GDK with support of new compiler options in TEXT DLL
 * Added an extra parameter to COMPARECASE function of GDK
 * Fixed several 3D MATH VECTOR bugs in GDK (also exposed in DBPRO)
 * SET CAMERA TO IMAGE - when alpha-surface mode 2 is used, backdrop clear works again
 * dbSetShadowShadingOff was listed incorrectly in the header files, this is now correct
 * added dbSetShadowPosition into Basic 3D
 * dbDeleteEffect caused a crash, this function now checks all objects that may reference this effect and clears the reference
 * added float dbObjectSize / dbObjectSizeX / dbObjectSizeY / dbObjectSizeZ ( int iID, int iUseScaling ) into Basic 3D
 * dbObjectSize now works with instanced objects
 * dbObjectCollisionCenterX, dbObjectCollisionCenterY and dbObjectCollisionCenterZ now work with instanced objects
 * corrected function listings for dbLoadDLL, dbDLLCallExist and dbCallDLL
 * resolved a problem with fog colour not being reset in the particle manager
 * changed to statically linking into the C++ runtime libraries
