Upgrade 7.0
===========

Updater
-------

 * Added additional dialog to ask for destination folder (multiple DBP installations)

Help
----

 * Help files replaced with new help system that covers all previously 'undocumented' commands plus visual overhaul
 * Tweaked many examples to align better with latest update, correcting small issues in the code (samples too fast)
 * Added 91 missing examples to a range of commands across the board (feature creep)
 * Added 49 more missing command documentations plus examples (GameFX module)
 * Added media to GFX folder to solve missing help layout graphics
 * Added missing parameter to MAKE OBJECT PLANE (MAKE OBJECT PLAIN)
 * SET BLEND MAPPING explained better
 * Added missing FLUSH LIGHT MAPS command in help
 * Adjusted typical float descrioption value from 2.5 to 0.5 (for COS sense)
 * Specified that HSIN, HCOS and HTAN must be specified as angles in degrees
 * Fixed CALL DLL help pages to reflect correct parameter types
 * Completely removed TEXTURE BACKDROP from help system (discontinued)
 * Updated GET IMAGE with original texture flag description to avoid confusion
 * Additional help information provided for CHECKLIST FOR OBJECT LIMBS
 * COMPILE CSG removed from help files, command discontinued years ago
 * Updated examples in two camera examples for UPDATE MATRIX addition
 * Fixed typo in the command help LIMB VISIBLE
 * Updated KEYWORDS with correction for MAKE OBJECT PLANE
 * #INCLUDE and #CONSTANT renamed from _INCLUDE and _CONSTANT
 * Updated LIMB EXIST and LIMB VISIBLE command pages

Compiler
--------

 * Executables no longer create a SW_NORMAL window on the taskbar, using SW_HIDE instead
 * NOTE: To run a DBP EXE in native Vista, ensure you copy in D3DX9_31.DLL

Matrix
------

 * Randomize matrix is now truely random and not predictable on rerunning code

ConvX
-----

 * Added support for DECLDATA field in newer X file exports (supports XYZ+NORMALS+UV+DIFFUSE only)
 * Above addition helps support new exporter in Truespace 7.6 free version

Core
----

 * Fixed bug causing frustrum not to calculate for cameras with FASTSYNC

Basic3D
-------

 * Fixed culling of objects involving multiple cameras (frustrum planes calculated after vis check instead of before)
 * Increased cap of bones allowed for shaders from 32 to 60 (new DBP shader limit)
 * Added additional detection of excluded objects to speed up largr object use apps
 * Duplicated MAKE OBJECT PLAIN with MAKE OBJECT PLANE to correct a very old typo
 * Added extra object check at DrawObject call to ensure null-objects not drawn!
 * Removed runtime error if try to FVF convert mesh with more than 65535 vertices
 * Added missing parameter of Mode to MAKE OBJECT PLANE
 * Fixed MAKE MESH FROM OBJECT so it once again converts strips to tri lists (fixed)

Camera
------

 * Added Philips 2D+Depth support as stereoscopic mode 3 (requires special internal build of DBProSetupDebug.DLL (WOW build))
 * Added new mode and parameter to SET CAMERA TO IMAGE : Mode 3 uses extra parameter to specify D3DFMT value for image

 * Added two new modes to SET CAMERA CLIP (3&4 same as 1&2 except they are for shaders)

Image
-----

 * Corrected bug from U69 causing LOAD IMAGE to resort to zero-mipmap mode (BETA2 onwards)

Setup
-----

 * Require special DBProSetupDebug.DLL (WOW build) alongside stereoscopic mode 3 usage

Bitmap
------

 * SET CURRENT BITMAP now accepts a negative number, which specifies a camera target using the positive equivilant of the negative number.
