Patch 3
=======

GENERAL
-------
* SELECT statement in FUNCTIONS now works correctly
* Proper casting of input parameters of a condition revealed by code 'if a#>a(0)'
* Internal SpeedOverStabilityFlag for the compiler, to allow for 'safe' default DBV1 style code
* Conditional Comparisons that have no comparison symbol now work, even with arrays and variables
* Indirect (*) operations can now take place inside functions as normal
* Compiler now handles Third Party Command string tables that do not use decorated names (Delphi)
* Compiler can now handle the presence of TYPEs within REMSTART/REMEND blocks
* RND command now returns an integer value as it should be
* Improved code for instances where result values casting back to variables are accurate
* Variables within functions that had no defined type would crash a function on exit
* Compiler can now determnine the difference between a float and double float immediate
* Fixed a bug that caused multiple arrays into a READ command to crash, now fixed
* Holding down delete key on an INPUT command caused a huge resource drain and crash, now fixed
* Adjusted SYNC RATE to better reflect a better refresh at this value - added help too
* Can now place comments between the last case and the endselect command
* RESTORE within a function and label data outside of a function now works correctly
* Arrays declaraed with an unknown type would crash the compiler, now reports good error
* Compiler and engine can now handle more advanced TPC DLLs that use core data
* Changed FLOAT to DOUBLE cast again so it retains the extra un-seen information (for accuracy)
* ..and changed the PRINT FLOAT command to display regular float values
* ..and added a new STR$() which now takes a double float value you want the extended float displayed
* When global arrays within no clue as to type is used within function, the true type is used
* Variables using custom types and not specifying a field name now produces an error
* WRITE MEMBLOCK DWORD now handles the full range of DWORD values, and not the silly 22 million limit
* Comments can now be appended to DATA statement and FOR-NEXT lines without a compiler error
* CONSTANTS are now handled better by parsing the program only once to prevent multiple iterations
* Added Support for VAL to return DOUBLE INTEGERS to support very large numbers
* Due to a parse error, A = A * -1 with spaces caused the equation to produce the wrong result
* CALL DLL that returns a value would not detect params over five, now fixed.
* SELECT statement within a function can now handle arrays and array string as well as variables
* Ensured that the A=A*-1 error did not introduce another bug which crops rightmost characters

BASIC3D
-------
* Older cards can sometimes cause a general DirextX error - so more details added
* MAKE OBJECT TRIANGLE no longer crops float values to integers during triangle creation
* DOT command and POINT command fixed use 32bit values, and conversions down to 16bit when required
* DOT X,Y,Col now works like DOT X,Y with the exception of no limit checks for a speed boost
* Objects that are glued and culled no longer disappear when they should be visible again
* Objects would not load in with a COLORKEY MASK, now all internal textures use a RGB(0,0,0) colorkey
* LOCK OBJECT now works like DBV1 in that FOV will not affect its rendering in any way

3D COLLISION
------------
* Updated collision system further for perfect poly-to-sphere check solving low poly collision issues
* SET OBJECT RADIUS now affects bnoundboxes where box collision is used instead of sphere collision
* In improving the collision for polygons, found a bug involving scale of polygon detection, also fixed

LIGHT
-----
* set normalization on command now works correctly, as does the override when fade object is used

MATRIX
------
* Fixed bug that caused matrix tiles to use first row correctly, the remaining rows reversed

BSP
---
* Changed SET BSP COLLISION HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT so a positive value now means upward adjustment
* Added HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT for Objects and also Quake3 BSP Collision too

IMAGE AND BITMAP
----------------
* LOAD BITMAP now no longer dithers, scales or stretches leaving the image integrity intact


SPRITES
-------
* Mirror and Flip now work with CREATE ANIMATED SPRITE correctly and texture data handling improved
* CREATE ANIMATED SPRITE can now handle images of nonstandard size ie 1024x768 non square texture
* PASTE SPRITE does not work if the sprite has been hiden, now fixed
* Fixed PLAY SPRITE so anim settings can be changed even during an existing sprite animation
* ROTATE SPRITE and PASTE SPRITE did not work well together, bug now fixed

TEXT
----
* ASCII Characters 128-255 where not supported by the text commands, now fixed
* Text width and height commands and internal use of same function no longer causes huge scrolls


FILE
----
* Files that have been locked by other processes and tried to delete, causes a runtime error


LIMITATIONS OF USE
------------------
* Placed safe code back into the GOTO command, to allow for a minimum screen refresh scan. The compiler now has a flag to deactivate this and will feature as an option in the editor soon
* Added code to check for a negative value in the demo count registry entry so such hacking is discouraged, where upon the CD will be requested.
