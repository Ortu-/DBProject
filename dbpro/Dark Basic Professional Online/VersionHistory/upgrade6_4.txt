Upgrade 6.4
===========

General
-------

 * Fixed certificate viewer to handle more then 12 icons when the window expands
 * Reverted DBPro DLLs to DirectX October 2006 - for better backwards compatibility

Basic3D
-------

 * LOAD EFFECT - if 'resourcename' is blank, those textures are treated as dynamic
 * Fixed TEXTURE OBJECT so that the stage value is written into the texture stage data itself

Camera
------

 * SET CAMERA TO IMAGE - when alpha-surface mode 2 is used, backdrop clear now works
