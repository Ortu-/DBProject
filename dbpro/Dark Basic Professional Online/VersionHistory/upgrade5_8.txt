Upgrade 5.8 BETA1-290305
===========

Information
-----------

 * Created a series of snippet examples that demonstrate all the fixes from the MAR05BUGLIST

General
-------

 * Fixed debugger crashes so that large programs can be traced and stepped through
 * Sured up compiler to allow better integration with debugger
 * Reverted to the older DX 9.0c runtimes for U58 until MS release the new 2005 runtimes

Compiler
--------

 * Booleans and other sub-DWORD sized varaibles can now be used as condition parameters
 * Indirect addressing now allows you to assign, read and print the value, ie print *ptr
 * Indirect addressing such as *ptr now also works for basic conditions
 * Better parsing of conditions where brackets are used inside speed marks
 * You can now have speech marks, of an odd number in the REMSTART/REMEND block
 * Speed improvements - open setup.ini in the compiler folder, add a group named "[DIRECTIVES]", and an item below this "RemoveSafetyCode=Yes", recompile your program, this solves problems where loops may cause slow down and may significantly increase frame rates
 * Host of fixes centered around comments beig parsed, variable handling and error runtime data
 * Quotes allowed in REMSTART REMEND block, and REMBLOCK also allowed in SELECT CASE statement
 * Changed compiler error 57 to better describe the need to have same function return types
 * Can now place comments onto the end of a function declaration
 * Fixed parsing of declarations so initialisation values are retained

Basic3D
-------

 * Collision against sphere objects (tristrips fixed), no longer crashes out
 * SAVE OBJECT no longer saves animated vertex data - uses original data
 * LOAD OBJECT no longer crashes if the file contains some forms of invalid data
 * X Files can now be loaded with their vertex colours taken into account
 * Setting the material diffuse/ambient/etc components will now affect models using multimaterial data
 * When transparency is used, zwrite is no longer reset (ignored)
 * Instances that use animating bone objects now animate even when source object is not visible
 * Deleting objects that are used as shadows or reflections no longer lingers
 * Fixed problem of NOZDEPTH object causing ghostMatrix to render with no Zbuffer information
 * In respect of the above command DOTPRODUCT3 bump mapping once again possible
 * OBJECT IN SCREEN commands now account for the multiple camera viewport settings
 * When mesh bounds are created their buffers are updated straight away meaning they will be drawn instantly
 * Textures are now allowed if the shader does not specify the useTexture flag in LOAD EFFECT
 * Animation now updates the boundbox from pre-created boundsarray (for speed), and fixed from B2
 * Added extra code which uses the new exclusion flag of objects to skip code to speed up program
 * Pick object now ignores culled polygons unless the CULL flag is set to zero
 * CONVX now loads meshes even if the materiallist has only a single material entry (X file fix) 
 * Put back ability for shaders using PS and not specifying internal textures to work again!


 * Additional commands upgraded to public release, undocumented for U58.

   PERFORM CSG INTERSECTION TargetObject, BrushObject
   PERFORM CSG UNION ON VERTEXDATA BrushMesh
   PERFORM CSG DIFFERENCE ON VERTEXDATA BrushMesh
   PERFORM CSG INTERSECTION ON VERTEXDATA BrushMesh

   rem New Object Commands
   SET GLOBAL OBJECT CREATION SharedVBMode
   SAVE OBJECT Filename$, ObjectNumber
   CLONE OBJECT ObjectNumber, SourceObject, ShareOriginalData
   EXCLUDE OBJECT ON ObjectID
   EXCLUDE OBJECT OFF ObjectID

   rem Texture Stage Management

   SET OBJECT FILTER ObjectNumber, StageNumber, Flag
   SET BLEND MAPPING ON ObjectNumber, StageIndex, ImageNumber, TexCoordMode, BlendMode

   rem Shadow Commands
   SET SHADOW SHADING ON ObjectNumber, MeshNumber, ShadowRange, UseShader
   SET SHADOW SHADING OFF ObjectNumber
   SET SHADOW POSITION Mode, X, Y, Z

   rem Extra Collision Support
   SET OBJECT FRAME ObjectNumber, Frame, RecalculateBounds
   CALCULATE AUTOMATIC COLLISION

Image
-----

 * Confirmed that you cannot save successful BMP files in FullScreen mode (DX9.0c bug)
 * Texture Flag of 2 in LOAD IMAGE will now allow CUBE maps to be loaded directly
 * Updated Image DLL to save out all sizes of bitmaps, including those not to a power of two
 * LOAD IMAGE now brings back alpha of images using SET IMAGE COLORKEY during pixel perfect

Camera
------

 * MAKE CAMERA now sets the camera ID internally so SET CURRENT CAMERA is not depended upon
 * Fixed camera angle readout so it matches the way the object freeflight angles read out

Animation
---------

 * Animation - the set animation speed command only applies to mpg and avi, wmv is currently not supported
 * Animation - set animation volume command, help is incorrect, full volume is 0 and lowest volume is -10000

Sprite
------

 * Sprite - when using animated sprites the image dimensions are retained resulting in no more stretching
 * Sprite - alpha testing disabled with sprites, stops problems with sprites not showing when objects are in certain transparent modes
 * Sprite - animated sprites updated to use correct transparency

Light
-----

 * Lights - fixed a problem with fog colour

Music
-----

 * Music - no error shown when volume is above 100, also note that the maximum volume value is 100, anything over this makes no difference

Input
-----

 * Input - mouse z value no longer reset when the mouse is positioned manually

Basic2D
-------

 * Basic 2D - dot and point commands can now be used on bitmaps that are larger than the screen resolution
 * Basic 2D - and modified so the draw commands do not overwrite memory of bitmap zero (screen)

Sound
-----

 * Sound & Memblocks - when creating memblocks from sounds and sounds from memblocks the data format is retained so the sounds are played back correctly. this has altered the memblock format

Text 
----

 * Text no longer corrupts when change the text size and text size texture plate use improved

Multiplayer
-----------
 
 * Multiplayer - fixed problem with net buffer not moving onto the next message in the queue

System
------

 * Setting the windows layout to a caption and popup no longer leaves corrupt window borders

Multiformat Support
-------------------

 * Q3 BSP - number of polygons drawn is updated for global statistics
 * MD2 - updated animation handling code
 * MD3 - updated animation handling code
 * MDL - updated animation code
 * 3DS - improved loading code

Advanced Terrain Expansion Pack
-------------------------------

 * Terrain - if you want to hide limbs manually then don't call the update terrain command
 * Terrain - save terrain command implemented
 * Terrain - load terrain command fully implemented
 * Terrain - culling now takes into account terrain position
 * Terrain - collision data is updated when a terrain has been repositioned
 * Terrain - tested shaders with terrain, not come across any problems
 * Terrain - fixed a crash when display mode was changed
 * Terrain - default values now applied, no longer crashes if all functions are not called
 * Terrain - when loading a saved terrain note that you cannot adjust it's properties and rebuild, calling "build terrain" on a loaded terrain will casue an error message
 * Terrain - error message shown on "load terrain" command if non standard extension used

Cloth & Particles
-----------------

 * The color effector add key command now returns the correct value

Enhancement Pack
----------------

 * Speech - the speech commands no longer pause until finished allowing programs to continue with execution
 * Ogg Vorbis - volume can now be set correctly
 * Ogg Vorbis - get state returns the right value
 * File Blocks - if you add a file to a block and the file already exists it will be overwritten, previously the behaviour was to create an additional copy
