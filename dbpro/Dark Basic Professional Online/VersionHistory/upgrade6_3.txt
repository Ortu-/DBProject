Upgrade 6.3
===========

Basic3D
-------

 * SET FRAME recalc bounds now requires mode 2 to recalculate ALL the frames bounds (slow)
 * SET OBJECT RADIUS when given a radius of -1.0 will cause the object not to be visually culled
 * Added new param: LOAD EFFECT XXX , DoNotGenerateExtraData (1-dont generate tangents)

Camera
------

 * When a new camera is created it is internally sorted by index (rather than instance order)
 * Fixed SYNC MASK bug which caused secondary cameras to wipe out cameras masked out
 * Removed the power of two limit on the SET CAMERA TO IMAGE command, supporting newer cards
