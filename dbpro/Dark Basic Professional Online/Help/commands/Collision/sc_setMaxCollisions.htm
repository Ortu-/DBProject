    SC_setMaxCollisions maximum

<BR><BR>
      
	<u>-maximum</u>:   the maximum number of collision points you want recorded.<br>
<br>

	sets the maximum number of collision points for use with commands that store multiple collision points.<br>
	Value should be between 4 and 500 (at least 3 are required for sliding collision)<br>
	if the number of collisions exceeds the value you set then only the maximum number of<br>
	points will be returned, but in this case it is unknown which points will be returned.<br>
	In either case all points will be ordered by distance, but if the maximum is exceeded<br>
	the actual closest point may not have been included.<br>
      The default number of points is 50.<br>
